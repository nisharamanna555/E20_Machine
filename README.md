# E20_Machine
This project uses C++ to mimic the functionality of an E20 machine. "asm.cpp" takes E20 assembly language as input and converts it into E20 machine language. "sim.cpp" takes an E20 instruction and outputs the machine state after. "simcache.cpp" takes a cache configuration as input and implements it as a simulated cache subsystem for E20 machine.
